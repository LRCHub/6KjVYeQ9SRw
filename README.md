[00:00.00] Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
[00:04.28] Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Hahaha, hahaha)

[00:17.74] (Mm)
[00:20.13] (Dracula, Dracula)
[00:29.47] The morning light is turning blue, the feeling is bizarre (Bizarre)
[00:33.38] The night is almost over, I still don't know where you are
[00:37.62] The shadows, yeah, they keep me pretty like a movie star
[00:42.06] Daylight makes me feel like Dracula (Dracula)
[00:46.62] In the end, I hope it's you and me (You and me)
[00:50.70] In the darkness, I would never leave (Never leave)
[00:54.05] You won't ever see me in the light of day
[00:58.46] It's far too late, the time has come
[01:02.78] I'm on the verge of caving in, I run back to the dark (To the dark)
[01:06.77] Now I'm Mr. Charisma, fuckin' Pablo Escobar
[01:10.94] My friends are saying, "Shut up, Jennie, just get in the car" (Hahaha)
[01:15.38] I just wanna be right where you are (Oh, my love)
[01:20.02] In the end, I hope it's you and me (You and me)
[01:24.06] In the darkness, I would never leave (Never leave; I won't leave her)
[01:27.25] We both saw this moment comin' from afar (Comin' from afar)
[01:31.82] Now here we are (Here we are)
[01:34.02] Run from the sunlight, Dracula
[01:38.26] Run from the sunlight, Dracula
[01:42.50] Run from the sunlight, Dracula (Run from the sun)
[01:46.54] Isn't the view spectacular? (Dracula)
[01:53.78] Hey, Kevin, what's up? (Haha)
[01:55.92] Come pull up in my spot
[01:57.50] Let's keep the night glowing, I don't ever wanna stop (Hahaha)
[02:00.32] I'll never leave this floor, got me needin' more (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
[02:02.82] Sky is turning blue, let it clear the smoke
[02:05.06] Lip-stain on the rim, bass is 'bout to blow (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
[02:07.02] Sinking in my teeth, I buy time
[02:09.18] But please, do you think about what it might mean? (Mean)
[02:15.32] 'Cause I dream about you in my sleep
[02:19.32] Would you ever love someone like me, like me? (Someone like me; Oh)
[02:26.53] In the end, I hope it's you and me (Oh, my love)
[02:30.97] In the darkness, I would never leave
[02:34.23] We both saw this moment comin' from afar (Comin' from afar)
[02:38.68] Now here we are (Here we are)
[02:40.68] So run from the sunlight, Dracula
[02:44.00] So run from the sunlight, Dracula
[02:49.16] Run from the sunlight, Dracula
[02:53.36] Isn't the view spectacular?
[02:57.52] So run from the sunlight, Dracula
[03:01.76] Run from the sunlight, Dracula
[03:05.73] Isn't the view spectacular? (Run from the sunlight, Dracula)
[03:10.36] Run from the sunlight, Dracula (Run from the sunlight, Dracula)
